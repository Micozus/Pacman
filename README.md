## Pacman minigame
######  Weekly task in [https://coderscamp.edu.pl/](https://coderscamp.edu.pl/) course

### **LIVE DEMO:** [click here](https://micozus.github.io/Pacman-MiniGame/)

Made in collaboration with [SixtyTo](https://github.com/sixtyto/) as a part of weekly assignment in CodersCamp JS course. 
I was mainly responsible for moving / collision and ai logic during developement while my coding partner prepared a skeleton and graphics to work with :)

Focus of this task was to practice group coding / branch merging and collaboration while also putting some focus on code you make.

**Tech used:**
1) JavaScript (ES6),
2) Babel,
3) Canvas to animate that thing :) 

**TODO, after deployment for us would be to:**
1) Adding more frames to the animations and work on collisions then,
2) Implementing "scatter" state of pacman ghost movement,
3) Make this spaghetti code modular :)
